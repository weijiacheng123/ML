'''
These files contain data for video game ratings given out by the ESRB. 
Both files contain 34 features. 32 of these contribute to the ESRB's assigned rating. 
The data has already been split into a train and a test file for you to use to train and test your model. 
Your goal is to create a model that will take the 32 features for each game and predict a rating. 
Keep in mind that the final output should be the name of the target rating and not the number. 
Please refer to this file which should match your output.

Using methods covered in class:

1) load the dataset and use the KNeighborsClassifier to train and test your model

2) Display all wrong predicted and expected pairs

3) produce a csv file of the name of the game and the predicted rating
